# ELM_JavadocClient_API_703

Plain Java Client Libraries API documentation, for 7.0.3

How This API Document Is Organized
This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.
Overview
The Overview page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each. This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.

Package
Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six categories:

Interfaces (italic)
Classes
Enums
Exceptions
Errors
Annotation Types
Class/Interface
Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:

Class inheritance diagram
Direct Subclasses
All Known Subinterfaces
All Known Implementing Classes
Class/interface declaration
Class/interface description
Nested Class Summary
Field Summary
Constructor Summary
Method Summary
Field Detail
Constructor Detail
Method Detail
Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.

Annotation Type
Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:

Annotation Type declaration
Annotation Type description
Required Element Summary
Optional Element Summary
Element Detail
Enum
Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

Enum declaration
Enum description
Enum Constant Summary
Enum Constant Detail
Use
Each documented package, class and interface has its own Use page. This page describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any part of the given class or package. Given a class or interface A, its Use page includes subclasses of A, fields declared as A, methods that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A. You can access this page by first going to the package, class or interface, then clicking on the "Use" link in the navigation bar.
